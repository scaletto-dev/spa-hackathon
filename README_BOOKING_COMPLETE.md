### Data Flow
```
User Completes Booking 
  ↓
POST /api/v1/bookings (create booking)
  ↓
Booking created with reference number
  ↓
POST /api/v1/bookings/{id}/send-confirmation (send email)
  ↓
Email service fetches all details
  ↓
HTML email generated
  ↓

```

### Email Read-Only Feature
```typescript
// When logged in:
<Input disabled={true} readOnly={true} value={userEmail} />
// Email is pre-filled and can't be edited

// When not logged in:
<Input disabled={false} readOnly={false} />
// Email field is editable
```
