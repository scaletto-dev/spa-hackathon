# Scope Adjustment: Backend-First Approach (API Development Priority)

### Overview

**Critical Context:** The clinic's website will be built in phases. **Phase 1 focuses exclusively on backend API development** to establish a solid foundation. Frontend UI development will follow in subsequent phases once the API layer is complete and tested.

### Current Phase: Backend API Development ONLY

**What We Are Building in Phase 1:**

1. **Backend API Development (EXCLUSIVE FOCUS)**
   - Build complete RESTful API using Node.js + Express
   - Design and implement database schema with PostgreSQL via Supabase and Prisma ORM
   - Implement all business logic for bookings, authentication, content management
   - Configure Supabase Auth for email OTP authentication
   - Implement Redis caching for performance optimization
   - Set up file storage using Supabase Storage for images
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints
   - Implement security measures (rate limiting, input validation, authentication)

2. **API Testing & Documentation**
   - Create Postman/Insomnia collection for all endpoints
   - Document request/response schemas for each endpoint
   - Provide example API calls and responses
   - Set up automated API testing suite

### What is NOT in Current Scope

**Phase 1 Exclusions (Deferred to Future Phases):**

- ❌ **No Frontend UI Development** - No React components, pages, or styling
- ❌ **No UI Integration** - No API consumption from frontend
- ❌ **No User Interface Design** - No mockups, wireframes, or visual design
- ❌ **No End-User Testing** - Focus on API testing only (Postman/automated tests)
- ❌ **No Client-Side Code** - No JavaScript/TypeScript for browser execution

### Epic Interpretation for Phase 1

When epics reference "Create UI" or "Implement pages," interpret as:
- **"Build API endpoints to support [Feature/Page]"**
- Focus on:
  - RESTful endpoint design and implementation
  - Database queries and data modeling
  - Business logic and validation rules
  - Response formatting and error handling
  - API documentation
- **Defer all UI work** to Phase 2

### Requirements Scope for Phase 1

- **Functional Requirements (FR):** Implemented as **backend API capabilities**
  - Example: FR8 "Guest users must be able to initiate booking" → Build `POST /api/v1/bookings` endpoint accepting guest data
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** Apply to **backend services**
  - Performance: API response times, database query optimization
  - Security: Authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting
  - Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, API contract tests
- **Technical Requirements:** **Backend-focused only**
  - Database design and migrations
  - API architecture and patterns
  - Testing infrastructure
  - Development environment setup

### Success Criteria for Phase 1

- ✅ All backend APIs functional and tested (80%+ test coverage)
- ✅ Database schema complete with proper relationships and indexes
- ✅ Authentication system working (Supabase Auth integration)
- ✅ All business logic implemented (booking, availability, notifications)
- ✅ API documentation complete with examples
- ✅ Postman collection available for manual testing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met (API response < 200ms)
- ✅ Security measures in place (rate limiting, validation, encryption)
