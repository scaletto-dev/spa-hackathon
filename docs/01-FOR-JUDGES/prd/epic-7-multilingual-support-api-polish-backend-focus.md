# Epic 7: Multilingual Support & API Polish (Backend Focus)

**Expanded Goal:** Implement **backend support** for multilingual content delivery and final API refinement. Enable language-specific content retrieval, implement language-aware email notifications in 4 languages (Vietnamese, Japanese, English, Chinese), optimize API performance, complete comprehensive testing, and finalize API documentation. This epic ensures the backend is production-ready with international capabilities.

**Note:** Frontend i18next integration and UI translations are deferred to Phase 2.
