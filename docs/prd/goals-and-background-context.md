### Background Context

The beauty clinic industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, with customer expectations increasingly shaped by seamless online booking experiences in hospitality, fitness, and restaurant sectors. Currently, potential customers face significant friction with phone-only booking systems restricted to business hours, lack of detailed service information, and language barriers for international clientele. This results in lost customer acquisition opportunities, excessive staff time handling repetitive inquiries, and competitive disadvantage against clinics offering modern digital experiences.

The Beauty Clinic Care Website addresses these challenges by creating a comprehensive digital platform that serves as the central hub for service discovery, branch information, and appointment booking. The platform's dual-user model uniquely accommodates walk-in booking culture while incentivizing membership through enhanced features. With full multilingual support across four languages and mobile-first design, the platform positions the clinic to capture both domestic and international market segments while building the foundation for future digital services including e-commerce and telemedicine capabilities.
