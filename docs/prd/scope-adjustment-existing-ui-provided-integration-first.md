# Scope Adjustment: Existing UI Provided (Integration-First Approach)

## Overview

**Critical Context:** The clinic's website frontend has already been designed and implemented externally as a complete, standalone React application. The existing UI includes all pages, components, layouts, and styling needed for the full user experience.

## What Exists (Pre-Built Frontend)

The existing frontend implementation includes:
- **Complete React Application** with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- **All User-Facing Pages:** Homepage, Service Catalog, Service Details, Branch Listings, Branch Details, Contact Page, Blog/News, Reviews
- **Booking Flow UI:** Complete multi-step booking interface for both guest and member flows
- **Member Features:** Registration forms, Login pages, Member Dashboard, Profile management, Booking History
- **Admin Portal UI:** Full admin interface for content management, booking oversight, review moderation
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first implementation with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- **Component Library:** Reusable UI components built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- **Routing Structure:** React Router implementation with all routes defined
- **Static Assets:** Images, icons, fonts, and other media assets

## Project Focus: Backend + Integration

For this project, development work focuses on:

1. **Backend API Development (Primary Focus)**
   - Build complete RESTful API using Node.js + Express
   - Implement all business logic for bookings, authentication, content management
   - Set up PostgreSQL database via Supabase with Prisma ORM
   - Configure Supabase Auth for email OTP authentication
   - Implement Redis caching for performance
   - Set up file storage using Supabase Storage

2. **Frontend Integration Work (Secondary Focus)**
   - **Connect existing UI to backend APIs** using Axios
   - **Implement state management** using React Context + Hooks for auth, language, theme
   - **Configure internationalization (i18n)** using i18next/react-i18next with 4 languages
   - **Integrate authentication flow** with Supabase Auth (login, register, OTP verification)
   - **Implement form validation** using React Hook Form + Zod
   - **Add error handling** and loading states for API calls
   - **Set up environment configuration** for API endpoints
   - **Minor UI adjustments** for API integration, accessibility fixes, or polish only

3. **Not In Scope**
   - ❌ Building UI components from scratch
   - ❌ Designing layouts or visual design
   - ❌ Creating new pages or major UI features
   - ❌ Rewriting existing React components
   - ❌ Major styling changes or redesign work

## Epic Interpretation

When epics reference "Create UI" or "Implement pages," interpret as:
- **"Integrate existing [Page/Component] with backend API"**
- Focus on API endpoints, data flow, state management, and business logic
- UI work limited to wiring up existing components with real data

## Requirements Scope

- **Functional Requirements (FR):** All FRs remain valid - they describe system behavior, which must be implemented in backend + integration
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** Performance, security, accessibility, and multilingual requirements apply to the integrated system
- **Technical Requirements:** Backend architecture, database design, API contracts, testing requirements remain unchanged

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All backend APIs functional and tested
- ✅ Existing UI successfully integrated with backend services
- ✅ Authentication, booking, content management flows working end-to-end
- ✅ 4-language multilingual support fully operational
- ✅ Performance and security requirements met
