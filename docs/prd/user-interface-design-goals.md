# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The Beauty Clinic Care Website aims to deliver a premium, spa-like digital experience that mirrors the quality and professionalism of the clinic's physical environment. The interface should feel calm, clean, and confidence-inspiring, using generous white space, high-quality imagery, and subtle animations to create a sense of luxury and trust. 

The user journey prioritizes **effortless booking conversion** through a progressive disclosure approachâ€”showing users only what they need at each step while maintaining clear progress indicators. For guests, the path from discovery to confirmed appointment should feel frictionless (under 5 minutes). For members, the experience becomes increasingly personalized with each visit, using familiar patterns that reduce cognitive load.

The multilingual experience must feel native in each language, not merely translated. Text length variations across languages (e.g., Vietnamese vs. Chinese) should be accommodated through flexible layouts that maintain visual harmony regardless of content length.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Mobile-First Touch Interactions:**
- Large, tappable targets (minimum 44x44px) with adequate spacing to prevent accidental taps
- Swipe gestures for image galleries and service browsing (using Swiper library)
- Pull-to-refresh pattern for member dashboard and booking history
- Bottom sheet modals for date/time picker and language selection on mobile
- Sticky "Book Now" floating action button that follows scroll on mobile

**Progressive Booking Flow:**
- Multi-step wizard with clear progress indicators (e.g., "Step 2 of 4")
- Persistent back navigation without losing entered data
- Real-time validation with inline error messages
- Pre-filled selections when user arrives from specific service or branch pages
- Summary card showing all selections before final confirmation

**Visual Feedback & Micro-interactions:**
- Skeleton loading states for content being fetched
- Smooth transitions between pages (300ms ease-in-out)
- Success animations (checkmarks, confetti) on booking confirmation
- Hover states on desktop with subtle scale/shadow effects
- Loading spinners with branded colors during API calls

**Trust-Building Elements:**
- Prominent display of facility photos and before/after imagery
- Star ratings and review counts visible on service cards
- Real-time availability indicators (e.g., "3 slots available today")
- Security badges near forms (SSL, data protection)
- Social proof (e.g., "500+ happy customers this month")

### Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA (Target)

While MVP timeline may limit full WCAG AAA compliance, we commit to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards including:
- Minimum 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible with visible focus indicators
- Alt text for all meaningful images, decorative images marked as such
- Form labels properly associated with inputs
- Error messages clearly linked to form fields
- Skip navigation links for keyboard users
- No reliance on color alone to convey information
- Captions for any video content
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels where native HTML semantics insufficient

**Note:** Full accessibility audit recommended post-MVP to identify gaps and prioritize improvements.

### Branding

**Current Brand Assets:** *(To be confirmed with stakeholder)*
- Logo and favicon (high-resolution versions for retina displays)
- Brand color palette (primary, secondary, accent colors)
- Typography guidelines (font families, weights, sizes)
- Brand voice and tone guidelines for content

**Assumed Brand Direction (based on premium positioning):**
- **Color Palette:** Calming, spa-like tones (soft pastels, whites, light grays) with accent color for CTAs (possibly rose gold, soft teal, or sage green)
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif for UI (clean readability), serif optional for headings (elegance)
- **Imagery Style:** Professional photography with natural lighting, authentic (not overly retouched), diverse representation
- **Iconography:** Minimalist line icons (consistent stroke width)
- **Motion:** Subtle, elegant animations (avoid jarring or playful)

**If brand guidelines don't exist:** Design system will be created during UX phase establishing:
- Color tokens (8-10 shades per primary/secondary/neutral)
- Typography scale (8 sizes from xs to 3xl)
- Spacing system (4px base unit)
- Component patterns (buttons, cards, forms)
- shadcn/ui will be customized with brand tokens

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive (Mobile-First)

**Primary Target:** Mobile devices (60-70% of traffic expected)
- **Mobile:** 360px - 767px (primary design focus)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px (comfortable single-hand use)
- **Desktop:** 1025px+ (optimal use of screen real estate)

**Responsive Strategy:**
- Mobile: Single column, stacked layouts, hamburger navigation, bottom CTAs
- Tablet: Two-column layouts where appropriate, sidebar navigation option
- Desktop: Multi-column grids (2-4 columns), persistent navigation, hover states

**Browser Support:**
- Chrome 90+ (most common in target markets)
- Safari 14+ (critical for iOS users)
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 90+

**No support for:**
- Internet Explorer (discontinued)
- Browsers older than specified versions above

**Future Consideration (Post-MVP):**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for "Add to Home Screen"
- Native iOS/Android apps if user demand justifies investment
