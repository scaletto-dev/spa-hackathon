# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Beauty Clinic Care Website**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project

This is a new project built from scratch. While no specific starter template was mentioned in the PRD, the architecture will follow best practices for:
- Monorepo organization (using npm workspaces)
- **React 18 + Vite 5** SPA (Single Page Application)
- Express.js RESTful API conventions
- Supabase integration patterns

**Build Tool Choice:** Using **Vite** instead of Create React App for significantly faster development experience (10-100x faster HMR) and optimized production builds.
