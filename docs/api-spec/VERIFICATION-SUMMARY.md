## ÌæØ Key Findings

### CRITICAL Priorities (Week 1)

1. **Booking Availability Check** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
   - Missing: `GET /api/v1/bookings/availability`
   - Impact: Booking flow cannot work without this
   - Effort: 3-5 days (complex scheduling logic)

2. **Staff Filtering** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
   - Missing: `GET /api/v1/staff/available`
   - Impact: Cannot filter therapists by branch/service
   - Effort: 2-3 days

3. **Upload Folder Routing** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
   - Current: Generic `POST /api/v1/admin/uploads`
   - Needed: `POST /api/v1/admin/uploads/:folder`
   - Impact: All admin image uploads broken
   - Effort: 1 day

4. **Google OAuth Security** Ì¥í SECURITY
   - Issue: Client-side JWT parsing (INSECURE)
   - Fix: Server-side verification required
   - Effort: 2-3 days

5. **Admin Domain Whitelist** Ì¥í SECURITY
   - Issue: Client-side check (bypassable)
   - Fix: Server-side enforcement
   - Effort: 0.5 day

### HIGH Priorities (Week 2)

- Profile endpoints (GET, PATCH)
- Client booking history
- Bulk delete operations (appointments, customers)
- Staff schedule view
- Dashboard metrics (complete fields)
- Revenue/payment chart data
- Payment export
- Auth scope clarification

**Total:** 15 items, 12-16 days effort

### MEDIUM Priorities (Week 3-4)

- Promo code validation
- Customer analytics
- Review metrics
- Blog by slug
- Nearby branch search
- Service distribution chart

**Total:** 9 items, 12-15 days effort

### LOW Priorities (Future)

- AI blog generator
- AI staff bio generator

**Total:** 2 items, 5-8 days effort

## Ì¥ç Field-Level Issues

### Breaking Changes Needed

1. **User ID Type** (BREAKING)
   - Current: `number`
   - Correct: `string` (Supabase UUID)
   - Impact: ALL auth endpoints

2. **Location Object** (HIGH)
   - Current: Flat or unclear
   - Correct: `{ lat: number, lng: number }`
   - Impact: Branches

3. **Specialties Array** (HIGH)
   - Current: Comma-separated string
   - Correct: `string[]`
   - Impact: Staff

### Non-Breaking Enhancements

4. **Tags Array** (MEDIUM)
   - Missing: Blog tags field
   - Add: `tags: string[]`

5. **Payment Method Enum** (MEDIUM)
   - Current: Generic `string`
   - Better: `"credit_card" | "cash" | "digital_wallet"`

6. **Date/Time Format** (MEDIUM)
   - Clarify: `date` = "YYYY-MM-DD", `time` = "HH:mm"
   - Timestamps: Full ISO 8601

## Ì∫Ä Quick Start for Teams

### Backend Team

**Week 1 (CRITICAL):**
```bash
# 1. Implement availability check
POST /api/v1/bookings/availability

# 2. Implement staff filtering
GET /api/v1/staff/available?branchId=2&serviceId=5

# 3. Fix upload folder routing
POST /api/v1/admin/uploads/services
POST /api/v1/admin/uploads/branches
# etc.

# 4. Server-side Google OAuth verification
# Verify JWT with Google, return session token

# 5. Enforce admin domain whitelist server-side
```

**Week 2 (HIGH):**
- Profile CRUD: `GET /api/v1/profile`, `PATCH /api/v1/profile`
- Booking history: `GET /api/v1/profile/bookings`
- Bulk ops: `POST /api/v1/admin/{resource}/bulk-delete`
- Dashboard charts: Revenue trend, service distribution
- Payment export: `GET /api/v1/admin/payments/export`

### Frontend Team

**Week 1:**
- Update auth to use server-side verification
- Remove client-side JWT parsing
- Test all auth flows

**Week 2:**
- Add pagination UI
- Implement envelope unwrapping `{ data, meta }`
- Update type definitions with corrected field types

## Ìæì Methodology

### Data Collection
1. **Routes Scan:** All paths in `route-map.tsx` (18 routes)
2. **Components Scan:** All React components (50+ files)
3. **Forms Scan:** All input fields, validations (12 modals)
4. **Tables Scan:** All table columns, filters (10 admin pages)
5. **CTAs Scan:** All onClick handlers (100+ actions)
6. **Types Scan:** `mockDataStore.ts` interfaces (8 entities)

### Analysis Techniques
- **Route ‚Üí API Mapping:** Every route needs GET endpoint
- **Form ‚Üí Request Body:** Form fields = required body fields
- **Table ‚Üí Response List:** Columns = response fields + meta
- **Filter ‚Üí Query Params:** Dropdowns = query parameters
- **CTA ‚Üí Side Effects:** Buttons = POST/PATCH/DELETE endpoints

### Evidence Format
```
FE Evidence: apps/frontend/src/path/to/file.tsx:123
```
Every gap/issue includes exact file + line number for verification.
