## üí¨ Review Comment Tags

**Use these tags in review comments:**

### **[BLOCKER] üî¥**
**Must be fixed before merge**

Example:
```
[BLOCKER] This creates a SQL injection vulnerability. 
Use Prisma's parameterized queries instead of raw SQL.
```

---

### **[CRITICAL] üü†**
**Should be fixed before merge (can merge if time-sensitive with plan to fix)**

Example:
```
[CRITICAL] This API endpoint is missing authentication. 
Anyone can access sensitive user data. Add auth middleware.
```

---

### **[SUGGESTION] üü°**
**Nice to have, can be addressed now or later**

Example:
```
[SUGGESTION] Consider extracting this logic into a separate hook.
Would improve reusability. Can be done in future refactor if preferred.
```

---

### **[QUESTION] üîµ**
**Asking for clarification**

Example:
```
[QUESTION] Why are we using setTimeout here instead of useEffect cleanup?
Is there a specific reason or should we refactor?
```

---

### **[NITPICK] ‚ö™**
**Minor style/preference issue, can ignore**

Example:
```
[NITPICK] Personal preference: I'd use a ternary here.
But current code is fine. Up to you!
```

---

### **[PRAISE] üü¢**
**Good code worth highlighting**

Example:
```
[PRAISE] Great error handling here! Clear messages and proper status codes.
Exactly how we should do it across the codebase.
```

Do you mean move it to a separate function or a custom hook?
```

**Providing context:**
```
üí° The reason I did it this way is because [explanation].
However, I'm open to the suggested approach if you think it's better.

## üìä PR Size Guidelines

### **Ideal PR Size**

| Lines Changed | Status | Action |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| 0-100 | ‚úÖ Small | Perfect size, fast review |
| 100-300 | ‚úÖ Medium | Good size, most PRs should be here |
| 300-500 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Large | Acceptable, but consider splitting |
| 500-1000 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Very Large | Should split if possible, add justification |
| 1000+ | üî¥ Huge | Must split or provide strong justification |

---

### **When Large PRs are OK**

- [ ] Boilerplate code (e.g., Story 1.1 monorepo setup)
- [ ] Third-party library integration
- [ ] Database migrations with many tables
- [ ] Code generation
- [ ] Justified in PR description

**If large, add note:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Large PR Notice**: This PR is XXX lines because [reason].
I've organized commits by feature for easier review:
- Commit 1: Setup
- Commit 2: Core logic
- Commit 3: Tests
- Commit 4: Documentation
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Review Turnaround Time

### **SLA Expectations**

| PR Size | Initial Review | Final Approval |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Small (0-100) | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Medium (100-300) | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| Large (300-500) | 8 hours | 1 day |
| Very Large (500+) | 1 day | 2 days |

**Note:** These are guidelines. Critical/blocking PRs can be prioritized.

---

### **Review Priority**

**High Priority (review immediately):**
- [ ] Blocks other developers
- [ ] Critical bug fix
- [ ] Tagged as "urgent"
- [ ] End of sprint

**Normal Priority (review within SLA):**
- [ ] Regular story completion
- [ ] Scheduled work

**Low Priority (review when available):**
- [ ] Documentation only
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] Non-critical improvements

---

## üöÄ Merge Process

### **Before Merging**

**Verify:**
- [ ] All reviewers approved
- [ ] All [BLOCKER] comments resolved
- [ ] All conversations resolved
- [ ] CI/CD checks pass (green checkmarks)
- [ ] Branch up-to-date with main
- [ ] No merge conflicts

---

### **Merge Methods**

**Use Squash and Merge** (default):
- ‚úÖ Cleans up commit history
- ‚úÖ One commit per story
- ‚úÖ Easy to revert
- Use for: Most feature branches

**Use Rebase and Merge** (alternative):
- ‚úÖ Preserves commit history
- ‚úÖ Linear history
- Use for: Well-organized commits with clear history

**Avoid Merge Commit**:
- ‚ùå Creates complex history
- ‚ùå Harder to track
- Only use: If specifically required

---

### **After Merge**

**Immediately:**
- [ ] Delete remote branch (GitHub auto-deletes usually)
- [ ] Pull latest main: `git checkout main && git pull`
- [ ] Delete local branch: `git branch -d epic1/1.X-story`
- [ ] Close linked issues
- [ ] Update team in Slack: "Story 1.X merged! ‚úÖ"

**Verification:**
- [ ] Pull main on different machine and test
- [ ] Verify app still runs
- [ ] Run smoke tests

## üéì Tips for Better PRs

### **For Authors**

1. **Self-review first**: Review your own PR on GitHub before requesting review
2. **Small PRs**: Keep PRs small and focused on one story
3. **Good descriptions**: Write clear PR descriptions with context
4. **Screenshots**: Always include for UI changes
5. **Test thoroughly**: Don't rely on reviewers to find bugs
6. **Respond quickly**: Address feedback within same day if possible
7. **Be gracious**: Thank reviewers for their time
8. **Learn from feedback**: Apply patterns to future work

---

### **For Reviewers**

1. **Review promptly**: Don't let PRs sit for days
2. **Be constructive**: Focus on improving code, not criticizing
3. **Be specific**: Vague feedback isn't helpful
4. **Explain why**: Don't just say "change this", explain reasoning
5. **Praise good code**: Positive feedback motivates
6. **Test locally**: Don't just read code, run it
7. **Consider context**: Understand constraints (time, scope)
8. **Be reasonable**: Distinguish "must fix" from "nice to have"
